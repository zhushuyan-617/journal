    Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
    through some interesting places on the way:

  <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
  <li>Magic City, ID,</li>
  <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
  <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
  <li>Why, AZ</li>
  <li>Trouth or Consequences, NM</li>
  </ol>

    I saw some Burema Shave style singns on the side of the
    road today:
  </P>
  <blockquote>
    Passing cars, <br>
    when you can't see, <br>
    May get you, <br>
    A glimpse,
    Of eternity. <br>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I definitely won't be passing any cars.
  </P>

    My first day day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
    everything packed and readly to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
    I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod,
    digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentilals.As
    Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins
    with one Segway."
